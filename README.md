# android-ExplicitIntent
Sample Android Application demonstrating the use of Explicit Intent(s).

Explicit intents are used to start a component in our own app, because we know the
class name of the activity or service we want to start.
For example,
starting a new activity,
starting a service in the background from within our app.
